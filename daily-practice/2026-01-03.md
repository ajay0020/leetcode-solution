## Problem
**1411. Number of Ways to Paint N × 3 Grid (Hard)**

Paint an N × 3 grid using 3 colors such that:
- No two adjacent cells (vertical or horizontal) have the same color
- Return total number of valid ways modulo 1e9 + 7

---

## Key Observation

Each row can be painted in **two pattern types**:

### Type A (ABA pattern)
- First and third cells same
- Middle cell different
- Count = 6

### Type B (ABC pattern)
- All three cells different
- Count = 6

---

## Dynamic Programming

Let:
- `A` = number of ways for Type A at row i
- `B` = number of ways for Type B at row i

### Transitions
newA = 3A + 2B
newB = 2A + 2B

---

## Initialization
A = 6
B = 6

## Final Answer
(A + B) % MOD


---

## Complexity
- **Time:** O(n)
- **Space:** O(1)

---

## Key Learning
- State compression in DP
- Pattern-based optimization
- Hard problem simplified using observations

✅ Daily consistency maintained.
