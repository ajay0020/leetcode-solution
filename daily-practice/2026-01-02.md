## Problem
**Repeated N Times (LeetCode – Easy)**

Given an integer array where one element is repeated N times,  
return the element that is repeated.

---

## Approach (Optimized)

- Traverse the array once
- Since the repeated number appears multiple times,
  it must repeat within the next 1–3 positions
- Compare:
  - nums[i] == nums[i+1]
  - nums[i] == nums[i+2]
  - nums[i] == nums[i+3]

---

## Algorithm
1. Loop from index `0` to `n-1`
2. Check nearby indices for equality
3. Return immediately when match found

---

## Complexity
- **Time:** O(n)
- **Space:** O(1)

---

## Key Learning
- Observation-based optimization
- Avoids extra memory
- Works because of problem constraints

✅ Daily consistency maintained.
